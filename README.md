## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I wanted to challenge myself and learn new skills that will benefit me as I transition from the food industry to the tech industry. 
I built this project to showcase who I am now and with some blood, sweat and tears, the developer I will be. 
I learned that humility and patience are vital to this work and to be successful.
